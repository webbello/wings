These words by PROPHET MUHAMMAD (PBUH) perfectly describe our aim at WINGS OF ESC. It is a matter of great satisfaction that we have access to good Institutes and are determined to succeed in life in our own fields.


	Of EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT COUNCIL, little need be said. It’s an impeccable institute with peerless contribution in education among the financially challenged class of the society.  We all are here in life to the sincere and dedicated support and guidance provided by Education Support Council (E.S.C.).  I passed out of ESC in 2007. Just after that, we, the students’ of ESC found it to be our bounden duty to come forward and extend our help and support to our younger brothers and sisters who need us most. This spark of giving back to society amongst us lit a lamp with the name of WINGS OF ESC on 03rd of May 2009. Since then I am attached with this noble cause.
Over the past decade, generations of like-minded students from ESC have been helping WINGS OF ESC carry forward the lamp of ESC in their existing capacities. WINGS OF ESC today is quickly becoming a hub of visionary and talented personalities where a dreamer can learn to fulfill his/her dreams learning from their experiences.

We are the nation-builders. We are the movers of technology. We are the agents of change. The knowledge that we gain, the fine qualities that we imbibe and the technical skills that we learn to apply, will be our major contribution to our parents, to society, and to the nation. Join us to contribute, to change ourselves, to change the world.
